# AUTISM-DETECTION
This is a simple machine learning model for detection of autism based on a mathematical model which is based on relative weights of the answers to the set of questions.
This set consists of 25 Questions regarding the behaviour of the Toddlers.
This set of 25 Questions is taken from a research test of Autism research centre - UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE
